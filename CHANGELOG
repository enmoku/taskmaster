## [0.12...]
### 2018-01-04
	Fixed: Volume settings in watchlist rules were not saved.
	Fixed: Some numeric scrolling controls reset when entering values manually, ignoring the user input.
	Improved: Watchlist rule validation.
	Added: Global hotkey ctrl-alt-shift-r now invokes rescan.
	Added: Global hotkeys can now be enabled in component configuration window.
### 2018-01-03
	Fixed: The dialog shown when you have already instance of TM running now actually CAN restart or kill the original instance.
	Changed: Exit procedure is different again. This may result in new crashes on exit.
### 2018-01-02
	Changed: Changing power behaviour attempts to restore power before continuing, such as the one set at launch.
		This makes disabling manual mode behave better, but in some cases this can cause
		power mode flickering briefly as the new behaviour takes over.
	Changed: Scan requests now invoke it via interaction with the timer instead of calling the scan directly.
		Hopefully making double calls to scan not happen.
	Internal: Various improvements to scanning.
### 2018-12-31
	Internal: Lots of changes. Config version upgraded.
### 2018-12-29
	Added: Option to disable logging of watchlist rules per rule. Only configurable in the Watchlist.ini for now.
### 2018-12-27
	Changed: Improved network availability reporting. It is much more responsive to changes and no longer gets stuck in disconnected state at times.
### 2018-12-24
	Removed: Per watchlist rule Rescan option. It was only used if global scanning was disabled.
		Since the mechanism is the same as global scan, it is recommended to just use potentially faster global scan instead.
### 2018-12-23
	Fixed: Clicking on tray icon now properly restores the window to visibility. Even when minimized.
	Added: The main window or the tray gaining user interaction temporarily lifts TM to higher priority to make it more responsive
		during user interactions. It pushes itself back to anonymity when this interaction ends.
### 2018-12-13
	Fixed: Volume management for watchlist rules was disabling UI elements incorrectly.
	Fixed: Path Visibility options 1 and 2 were swapped.
	Added: Basic implementation of smart path visibility.
	Removed: RegRun option of starting. This is not cleaned up. If you used it, please remove it manually.
	Changed: Session end detection and exit.
### 2018-12-12
	Added: High DPI-awareness. Untested, may simply be broken. On default 96 DPI this has no observable effect as expected.
	External: Serilog updated from v2.6.0 to v2.7.1
	External: NAudio updated from v1.8.4 to v1.8.5
	Fixed: Power mode changes from foreground only & background powerdown were far too spammy.
### 2018-12-11
	Fixed: Foreground hang detector can have some undesirable behaviour.
	Fixed: Loglist was sizing wrong. Hopefully fixed.
	Added: Option to reset power config added.
### 2018-12-10 Version 0.12
	Added: Watchlist rules now have description property for user comments.
	Changed: Visual styles are enabled. This was required to allow keyboard shortcuts in text fields like ctrl-a.
	Fixed: Reduced ListView flickering.

## [0.11...]
### 2018-12-09
	Fixed: Accidentally disabled tray context menu.
	Added: Logging for unhandled WinForms exceptions.
	Removed: The run once (--once) option. Unnecessary complication and not in spirit of what TM is for.
	Added: Ability to enable some experimental features via Core.ini [Experimental] section.
		Window Resize=true/false, Last Modified=true/false, and Temp Monitor=true/false
	Changed: Window Resize now no longer constantly rewrites the .ini
	Internal: Unified process modify output.
### 2018-12-07
	Added: Last modified list to the info tab, with option to copy path of the app to clipboard.
### 2018-12-06
	Added: UI option to toggle exit confirmation.
	Fixed: Exit confirmation setting now respected.
	Changed: Info tab re-enabled. Still work in progress.
	Internal: CPU monitoring moved out of power management to its own component.
### 2018-12-05
	Fix: Ensure restore mode & method are set.
	Fix: Ensure process exit is detected properly and that they're cleaned up.
### 2018-12-04
	Changed: Internet checking changed to be faster and smarter. Testing still required to verify.
	Internal: Better cleanup of event handlers
	Internal: Code cleanup
### 2018-12-03
	Changed: Process debug is now more detailed with more info on process debug tab.
	Fixed: Processing counter occasionally forgot to decrement.
### 2018-12-02
	Changed: CPU sampler pausing is more thorough.
	Changed: Debug is less spammy.
	Added: Power configuration has little bit more tooltip details.
### 2018-11-29
	Fixed: Watchlist copy to clipboard option was not including some options.
### 2018-11-28
	Changed: Powerdown delay is untouched in the .ini to allow swapping back and forth between settings.
		It is now simply ignored when it is problematic.
	Fixed: Component configuration was severely outdated.
	Removed: Immediate configuration saving. It was causing bugs for no real benefits.
	Fixed: Some oddities in power config saving.
	Fixed: Powerdown delay logic was flipped.
### 2018-11-27
	Fixed: Show Inaction was showing debug info for things that were not explicitly enabled.
	Added: Monitor power and power mode during session lock options added to power config.
	Fixed: Incorrect reading of some command-line arguments, notably --bootdelay which ignored the supplied number.
	Fixed: --bootdelay was not actually used, now it is. Max delay is 5 minutes.
	Added: Proper launch behaviour support. Auto-adjust option in Core.ini deprecated in favor of better Behaviour option.
### 2018-11-25
	Added: Show CPU sample frequency in power configuration. This is to help understand the delays involved.
	Fixed: Show Inaction was showing some debug information even when Process debug was not enabled as well.
	Fixed: Power config window was messing with high and low power mode backoff levels. Constrained to 1 to 20 instead of 5 to 95.
### 2018-11-20
	Added: Behaviour and Restore Mode configuration to power configuration UI
	Changed: 'Power auto-adjust configuration' is now just 'Power configuration'
	Fixed: 'Free memory for' option did not actually work properly if you selected anything besides the empty option.
### 2018-11-17
	Internal: A lot of changes that had been left for later. At most fixed some obscure bugs.
	Fixed: Path visibility option was not actually read from Watchlist.ini
### 2018-11-16
	Fixed: Wrong power mode selected in watchlist edit window.
	Changed: Power mode changes don't show for watchlist modifications to avoid spammyness from background powerdown setting.
	Added: Background affinity and priority control to watchlist edit window. Formerly only available via direct .ini editing.
	Added: Audio control to watchlist edit window. Formerly ony available via direct .ini editing.
	Changed: Watchlist edit window is now a little more logically sorted.
	FIXED: Components are now saved! This was broken not too long ago. Some other configuration savings were also enforced just in case.
	Changed: Watchlist edit window now has some features disabled if associated component is disabled.
### 2018-11-15
	Internal: Removed as much as possible of Serilog's formatted string usage. This should fix large number of output related bugs.
### 2018-11-13
	Added: 'Background affinity' added to complement 'Background priority' for foreground only option.
	Changed: Background priority application and restoration, it is now smarter about it.
	Internal: Massive refactoring, things may have broken.
### 2018-11-12
	Added: 'Path visibility' option to Watchlist. Currently only configurable directly through the .ini.
		Valid values are: 0=File (default), 1=File+Folder, 3=Full Path
		2 will be for "smart" visibility which is not yet implemented
	Added: Show inaction option now shows inaction relating to 'Ignore System32' option in Core.ini
	Changed: "# not paused; not resuming" message pushed to foreground debug.
	Changed: Better foreground debugging in general.
	Fixed: Bad logging for hung foreground apps.
	Internal: Power auto-adjust config presentation changed to make it easier to manage, possibly to allow more presets in the future.
	Internal: Process affinity and priority alterations are simplified. This should make them much more manageable for getting things right.
### 2018-11-11
	Fixed: Power auto-adjust settings were saved incorrectly.
	Changed: Power mode name strings are now more forgiving and varied.
	Changed: Info tab disabled until better use can be figured out for it.
### 2018-11-10
	Fixed: Power auto-adjust tuning was not saved if modified in the UI.
### 2018-11-09
	Fixed: Background powerdown setting was not saved from UI.
	Fixed: Watchlist power mode is now properly handled with auto, manual and rule-based power modes.
	Fixed: Powermode interaction with foreground only and background powerdown settings.
	Added: Audio Volume Strategy 4 and 5. 4 is Decrease from Full, 5 is Increase from Mute. Volume is untouched otherwise.
	Changed: Internet failure should be less spammy.
	Changed: Average uptime calculation.
	Changed: Crashing before logging system is online will cause custom crash.log to be written in logs folder instead of using EventLog.
	Internal: String handling changed.
### 2018-11-07
	Fixed: Exception handling in startup.
	Added: Multicore JIT profiling. This may speed up TM, especially for startup. First startup is unaffected.
### 2018-11-05
	Changed: Internal sanity checking reduced. We trust code that has not caused problems more.
	Changed: Trace output is no longer provided on non-debug builds.
	Changed: Console output disabled for non-debug versions.
	Internal: Removed several unused internal references (WindowsBase, System.Xaml, PresentationCore, PresentationFramework).
### 2018-10-31
	Fixed: Crash on last day of a month
	Fixed: Setting affinity strategy to ignored from force or limit in UI is now respected.
	Fixed: Watchlist formatting is now uniform whether you just started TM or modified a rule.
### 2018-10-22
	Fixed: Foreground only option did not prevent the app from being changed back by normal rescans, ignoring the foreground only option.
### 2018-10-13
	Added: Network interfaces now have copy full information option in context menu, which includes IPv4&IPv6 address and some traffic data.
### 2018-10-12
	Fixed: Altered foreground monitoring to no longer leak tiny amount of memory whenever an app that has foreground rules enabled
		closes down while in the foreground (most cases of normally exiting said apps).
	Changed: Memory log (used for displaying logs in the UI) is no longer static. This should not have any visible changes to users.
	Removed: Properties.Settings, it just didn't provide anything useful.
	Changed: How settings are saved.
		This may be buggy, such as not all settings being saved, this is mostly caused by uncertainty on how SharpConfig works.
### 2018-10-11
	Added: Option to mute network error logging (Configuration > Logging > Show network errors).
		This can get really spammy on certain networks without this option.
	Changed: Network errors are now immediately shown and they will stop showing after 5 consecutive reports.
### 2018-10-10
	Fixed: Errors that output stacktraces cause only 1 fatal error instead of 3.
	Added: Self-maintenance to run garbage collector once a day at midnight.
### 2018-09-19
	Fixed: Some internal locking. Should behave better in corner cases.
	Fixed: Exit behaviour. Should be more consistent.
	Fixed: Admin elevation from command-line arguments should be more reliable and not cause TM to just vanish on occasion.
### 2018-09-08
	Fixed: Potential permanent resource leakage related to static event handlers.
	Changed: IP changes are now in Info logging level instead of Debug.
	Added: Option to show affinity mask as bitmask or as decimal. Defaults to decimal. Bitmask is also no longer in reversed order.
	Changed: UI no longer shows "-- Any --" when nothing is configured and instead shows simply nothing.
	Added: Properties.Settings is now used for some configuration options, namely the new affinity mask option.
		This has some problems associated with it and may be transferred to the old .ini format.
### 2018-08-28
	Fixed: If no default microphone is set up, microphone manager won't crash the entire app.
	Added: Detect session end for clean shutdown.
### 2018-08-26

### 2018-07-20
	Fixed: An error retrieving process information when the process has already exited in foreground hang detector.
		Checked for other potential similar instances.
### 2018-07-17
	Fixed: An error retrieving process information when the process has already exited.
### 2018-07-08
	Added: Audio session management. `Watchlist.ini´ now has secret options `Volume´ and `Volume strategy´.
		Volume is floating point number from 0 to 1.
		Volume strategy ranges from 0 to 3. Meanings as follows: 0 = Ignore (default), 1 = Decrease, 2 = Increase, 3 = Either.

### 2018-06-22
	Fixed: Monitor sleep during session lock does not work sometimes.
### 2018-06-15
	Fixed: Network status changes were not being informed as they should've been.
	Changed: Removed some pointless network device list updates and only marked the need for refreshing.
	Changed: Made some code paths exit early if they detect process they're dealing with having exited.
### 2018-06-08
	Fixed: Rare(?) crash if session lock monitor power down is enabled.
### 2018-06-03
	Fixed: Network tab does not update address when IP changes while the UI is open.

### 2018-05-26
	Changed: Less spammy logging when internet connection is disrupted.
### 2018-05-25

	Fixed: Problems with new unconfigured TM setups.
### 2018-05-20
	Added: ctrl-alt-shift-m global hotkey to free memory except from current foreground app. This is disabled by default and requires enabling via `Register global hotkeys` in Core.ini.
	Changed: A lot of internal scheduling was altered, hopefully to make TM more responsive.
	Fixed: Rolled back a change that provided extended version information due to it causing crashes on some systems. Cause is known, fix is not.
### 2018-05-19
	Fixed: Watchlist rule edit window allowed entering garbage in affinity strategy.
	Changed: Saving a watchlist rule does not delete the old.
	Changed: Watchlist rules are no longer re-ordered when modified, as long as the friendly name remains unchanged. This is limitation of SharpConfig.
	Changed: Process affinity and priority adjusts now include a short text about failure to modify them.
	Added: `Persistent watchlist statistics` option in [Performance] section. Disabling it causes Watchlist.Statistics.ini no longer accessed.
	Changed: Some timestamp calculation changes, should have no end-user visible effects.
	Changed: Copy to clipboard for watchlist rules now includes ignore list, affinity strategy, recheck time, and correct executable name.
	Fixed: Cache eviction was apparently non-functional until a recent change. This change also revealed old debugging messages. These messages no longer show up under normal operation.
### 2018-05-18
	Changed: Refactored a lot of internal code, should have no impact for end-users.
	Fixed: Health monitor was not functional, now it is.
	Fixed: Paging had potential for leaking paging to where it wasn't supposed to happen. Still can, but it's lessened.
	Added: Affinity strategy can now be edited in the UI.
### 2018-05-17
	Added: Option to run with task scheduler on login instead of using the age old regrun method. Allows starting up automatically as admin.
	Fixed: Hopefully fixed some crashes related to WinForms? Maybe? Please?
### 2018-05-16
	Changed: `Increase` and `Decrease` options in `Watchlist.ini` are now `Priority strategy` with values from 0 to 3.
		0 = Ignore/Unset, 1 = Increase only, 2 = Decrease only, 3 = Force/bidirectional
		Upgrading to new settings should happen automatically for now.
	Added: Foreground app hang detector.
	Changed: Resize&reposition uses `Resize strategy` option instead of `Remember size` and `Remember position`.
		0 = None, 1 = Size, 2 = Position, 3 = Both
		Upgrading to new settings should happen automatically for now.
	Fixed: Resize & reposition settings should no longer reset to 0 under certain circumstances.
	Fixed: Uncaught error in app hang detector.
### 2018-05-15
	Fixed: Crash in watchlist rule editor if the affinity checkboxes were used.
	Changed: Internal restructuring, removed PostSharp usage due to its interfererence with build process. Should have no effect for end users.
### 2018-05-13
	Changed: Remember window sizes and positions works a little differently.
	Added: More debug output
	Changed: Affinity setting no longer increases the number of allowed cores. This may later become configurable to allow increasing them.
### 2018-05-12
	Changed: Explorer crash handling. Should be less convinced about explorer crashes when no such thing happened.
### 2018-05-11
	Changed: CPU sampling is simplified. May run better or worse.
	Changed: Debugging for health monitor low memory functionality.
	Changed: Health monitor memory option now respects the more general paging option.
### 2018-05-09
	Fixed: Network tab packet&error deltas were not functioning.
	Changed: Attempt to color errors in UI log.
### 2018-05-07
	Fixed: Apparently Task.Wait() hangs indefinitely under some obscure circumstances. Caused manual power mode to deadlock?
	Fixed: All CPUs mask was messed up.
	Changed: Power auto-adjust default configuration changed a tiny bit.
### 2018-05-06
	Fixed: Weirdness with full CPU mask affinity. -1 is now special value for ignore in UI instead of 0.
	Changed: Explorer crash handling. It's more informative which process crashed and should handle multiple explorer processes better.

### 2018-05-05 Version 0.10
	Changed: Allow watchlist rules with no affinity nor priority.
	Fixed: Empty network device list if it was last active tab.

## [0.9...]
### 2018-05-04
	Fixed: Validation does not find executables correctly.
	Changed: Some behind the scenes things to help catch an elusive problem with per-app power management.
	Fixed: Resize settings not changed when the rule was edited in UI.
### 2018-04-30
	Changed: Code cleanup.
### 2018-04-29
	Fixed: Clear UI log caused the log to not have anything after.
	Changed: Added a bit more logic to ensure tray becomes visible. May not actually help.
	Added: Option to ignore apps in %SYSTEMROOT%/System32. Enabled by default. Partial implementation.
	Removed: Support for case sensitive matching. Case will now always be ignored.
### 2018-04-28
	Added: Power down monitors when session is locked. Core.ini has two settings for this, one to control user idle timer and second for instant power down.
	Changed: Process adjusts are logged by default again.
	Added: Session lock actions are logged by default.
	Added: Configuration for the above added to Configuration>Logging and added two more debug options.
### 2018-04-25
	Added: [Debug] section in Core.ini with secret options to enable various debug functions at launch.
### 2018-04-24
	Fixed: Default power mode is not applied on start-up if auto-adjust is disabled.
	Removed: Experimental path location feature. Limited usability, documentation, and lack of desire to maintain it made it unwanted.
	Changed: You can now copy multiple lines from the log at the same time to clipboard.
### 2018-04-23
	Fixed: Error at HealthMonitor.cs:380 when foreground monitor was disabled.
	Changed: How empty watchlist is detected.
### 2018-04-22
	Fixed: Retarded WinForms bug.
### 2018-04-18
	Added: Health monitor now warns of low diskspace. Defaults to 150 MB.
	Added: Experimental feature to resize detected apps. Usable as `Resize={Top,Left,Width,Height}` in Watchlist.ini.
	Added: `Remember size=true/false` and `Remember position=true/false` in Watchlist.ini to control the `Resize` option.
	Fixed: Removing a rule did not do proper cleanup, causing rule with similar options to not work correctly without restart.
### 2018-04-17
	Added: Option to disable showing TM in taskbar. Found in Configuration > Behaviour in main window menubar.
### 2018-04-16

	Fixed: Resizing from window borders now works for main window.
### 2018-04-15
	Added: Extra debug relating to restarting TM.
	Added: Change log started. Older entries are based on scarce notes.
	Fixed: Event log being resized to very small size would hide it behind the above tab element.
### 2018-04-13
	Fixed: Some foreground process debug output.
### 2018-04-12
	Fixed: Unspecified log output fixes.
### 2018-04-11
